                 A great responsive website that targets customers from all works if life and different
                  background will have a website that has a good background contrast. This is important 
                  inorder to help the propective customer easily see where to click and get the booking done.
                   The contrast will ensure that the place that gives information on what the customer need to do
                    is designed with the background contrasting with the elements or the content of the website. 
                    The question should be what does the customer see and how is it being presented in relation to the background.</p>
                    <p>Contrast is the relationship between two or more design elements whose dramatic differences are emphasized 
                       when both elements are shown together. The degree of contrast between these elements is disproportionate to 
                       their level of similarity: the less similar two items are, the greater the contrast between them.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

                 Alignment as an effective web design principle allows us to make conscious decisions about how and where elements
                 are placed on the page. Taking advantage of strategic placement helps us to craft stronger and more compelling 
                 compositions and utilizing a grid system provides a standard guide for element placement. In applying  text, it 
                 explained the best way text appears  on the screen. For example, left-aligned text creates a straight line of 
                 text on the left side of the page (like this paragraph). Text can be aligned along the edge of a page, cell, div,
                 table, or another visible or non-visible line. It could also be explained as the responsive  is the arrangement
                 of elements on a page that keeps them from being a complete disorderly mess. 
            </p>
            <p>Aligning elements on a page tightens the design and creates a visual connection between them.In a website design 
               it is the arrangement of various items in relation to the various borders or edges of the allowable area. Alignment 
               in graphics design definition isn't much different from this. It literally means the lining of graphics and text in 
               relation to the various edges of the design canvas.</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>

                In web design, repetition helps users understand how interactive elements work. Repeating consistent elements
                 within a website gives the visitor a road map, and a way to navigate confidently around your site
            </p>
            <p>Repetition is simply repeating a single element many times in a design. For example, you could draw a line horizontally 
               and then draw several others next to it. Repetition can be useful in web and app design. For example, you'd expect the 
               logo of a business to be repeated on every page and in the same place</p>
